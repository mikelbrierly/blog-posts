_When developers sweep mistakes under the rug and cover up gaps in understanding with jargon and obfuscation, we reinforce the wall of imposter syndrome. Let's be inclusive and share what this journey is really like, warts and all._

## **Stuff I think is reasonable to not understand:**

ðŸ“Œ higher-order functions, threads, closure, execution context, recursion, OOP vs Functional programming, a million acronyms everyone seemed to be throwing around

## **Stuff I probably should have known:**

ðŸ“Œ Using an IDE, the difference between front-end and back-end, Node debugging and Chrome dev tools basics, using `debugger` instead of `console.log`, what is pure JS syntax and what is framework,

## **Stuff I'm not sure is "beginner" or not:**

ðŸ“Œ `this` and `prototype`, merge conflict resolution, reading documentation, the call stack, web API

I'm really curious what your thoughts are on this, and what your own lists will look like!
