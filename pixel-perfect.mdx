_CSS is a powerful, intricate language that gives the web beauty and life. **But** it also can make you want to throw your computer out of a four story window and never touch the front-end again._

---

Most frustration with CSS comes from a lack of understanding, which makes sense since it is often taught as an afterthought of web development. If CSS was treated like a language rather than a coat of paint, I think we would appreciate its value more.

All of the CSS we write eventually boils down to pixels displayed on a screen for our users to see and engage with. But the term `pixel` can be misleading when we are talking about the values in our stylesheets. It stands to reason that a "pixel" would be the smallest visible quantity that can be displayed on a screen. But in reality, a pixel is just... really small. (1/96 of an inch apparently, but who's counting)

[Here's what the spec says](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#reference-pixel):

> _The reference pixel is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm's length. For a nominal arm's length of 28 inches, the visual angle is therefore about 0.0213 degrees._

I was not enlightened by that explanation, so I took some bigfoot-esque photos of different physical screens displaying a single yellow CSS pixel.

![an older LG Monitor, an iPhone 8+, and a 2018 15" MacBook pro all displaying a single CSS pixel](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9jvv03o0wg8c4y9rutts.jpg)

###### _That's an older LG Monitor, an iPhone 8+, and a 2018 15" MacBook pro._

It looks like our 1 css pixel equated to: 1 screen px for the LG, maybe around 6 or 8 for the iPhone, and 4 screen px for the MacBook. That's just conjecture though, this is the important part:

## So what?

It's important to understand how our tools work, and when it is best to reach for them. `px` isn't the only fish in the sea.

> The CSS `px` value should be used when you need an absolute unit of measurement for an element that will not fluctuate in size on your page. (Or it will change very little)

---

There are _other_ units of measurement in CSS that can offer flexibility and responsiveness in ways that `px` fails to.

```
div {
  height: 10em;
}

div {
  height: 10rem;
}

div {
  height: 10vh;
}

div {
  height: 10%;
}
```

`em`: _Font size of the parent element_

`rem`: _Font size of the root element_

`vh`: _1% of the viewport's height_

`%`: _Usually a percentage of the nearest "sized" parent element_ (There are a lot of caveats to this one)

In my personal opinion, if you need a unit of CSS measurement that offers the most flexibility _and_ control, `rem` wins hands down. It is more predictable than `em`, and makes responsiveness a breeze when changing layouts or sizes for different screens. I won't get into the weeds here, it was **very** thoroughly explained in [this wonderful article](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/).

Hopefully you have a little extra nugget of knowledge when it comes to CSS units of measurement, cheers! üçª
